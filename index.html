We can create flat shapes by joining the edges of a plane. For example, taping the edges of a rectangle gives us a cylindrical shape, and if you tape the right and left edges of the cylinder, you would almost get a torus (a doughnut shape). </p></td>

           <td><p style = "font-size:20px;"> We can also cut and taped together spherical shapes, and each of the combined shapes would have a repeating patterns effect, but unlike the torus, there would be a finite number of copies. Yes, we don’t see backdrops of ourselves in the sky, but the universe could be so vast that the backdrop is too far away. In spherical geometry, triangles have angles that add up to over 180 degrees. Therefore, scientists have attempted to measure the angles of cosmic triangles, and have found that the Universe is either flat or very close to flat, keeping the universe as a sphere a possibility. </p></td>
