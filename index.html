As the first spike of Covid seemed to have been eradicated, public areas were re-opened and operated normally but proper precautions such as social distancing and mask-wearing were not always taken. This resulted in a surge of new cases, otherwise known as a new wave, from areas that were not hit previously but are now. </p>

Masks were still required, but public transportation, gathering, and office life resumed. By the end of late December, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium found themselves in the onus of a national lockdown, stalling till the vaccine arrived. </p>
